Revision history for Text-ANSITable
        - Fix smartmatch warnings (RT#85618)

0.14    2013-06-25 (SHARYANTO)

        No functional changes. Add 'use experimental "smartmatch"' for 5.18+.


0.13    2013-05-17 (SHARYANTO)

        - Tweak adjust width algorithm (now always fit wide table to terminal
          width, when possible).

        - Observe COLUMNS environment variable to override terminal width
          detection.


0.12    2013-05-17 (SHARYANTO)

        - Adjust wrappable columns' widths so table fits terminal width
          (currently naive algorithm)


0.11    2013-05-17 (SHARYANTO)

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Positive width/height setting value (cell_width/column 'width'
          style/cell_height/row 'height' should set maximum and clip content
          that are too wide/long. Previously it acted like a negative value
          (setting minimum and still widens/lengthens if content is too
          wide/long).

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add 'column_wrap'/column 'wrap' style for convenience. Previously you
          have to add a 'wrap' format for this.


0.10    2013-05-16 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add Text::ANSITable::ColorThemeUtil (moved from
          Text-ANSITable-ColorTheme-Extra, rename sub name)

        - Add get_border_style(), document get_{border_style,color_themes}.


0.09    2013-05-16 (SHARYANTO)

        Tweaks and small fixes.

        - Allow column_filter to specify column numbers instead of column names,
          convert them all to column names.

        - ansitable-list-{border-styles,color-themes} scripts: Give more visual
          indicator of selected theme/style (to make it clear under xvt, rxvt).

        - Tweak date column detection (moved routine from
          Data-Format-Pretty-Console).

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Date columns were not aligned middle.


0.08    2013-05-03 (SHARYANTO)

        - Better detect whether to use utf8 border, whitebg/blackbg color theme
          (using Term::Detect).


0.07    2013-05-03 (SHARYANTO)

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - To avoid potential overhead in the future, color_theme() and
          border_style() now requires "SubPackage::name" syntax to avoid listing
          and requiring all style/theme modules.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Observe ANSITABLE_{STYLE,COLUMN_STYLES,ROW_STYLES,CELL_STYLES} to
          customize almost everything via environment.

        - Add more FAQ items.


0.06    2013-05-03 (SHARYANTO)

        This release is a reorganization/tidying up of the API. Lots of
        renaming, sorry.

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Rename attributes 'column_{width,align,pad,lpad,rpad}' -> 'cell_*'.

        - Rename attributes 'row_{valign,vpad,tpad,bpad,height}' -> 'cell_*'.

        - {column,row,cell}_style() now split to
          {get,set}_{column,row,cell}_style() to make them stand out/different
          from table-level {column,row,cell}_* attributes. The set methods now
          can set multiple styles and check for known styles, but they no longer
          return old value.

        - cell() also split to get_cell() and set_cell() (to be more consistent
          with the above).

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add per-row/per-cell styles: align, valign.

        - Add more FAQ items.

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Setting column_align/column_valign didn't work.

        - Setting colors with ANSI escape codes didn't work.

        - Proof-read and update POD.


0.05    2013-05-02 (SHARYANTO)

        No functional changes. Fix bug which breaks Data::Format::Pretty when
        switching from Text::ASCIITable.


0.04    2013-05-02 (SHARYANTO)

        Make the default color theme more readable on terminal emulators with
        white background.


0.03    2013-05-02 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add attributes: column_width, row_height.

        - Add color theme: default_gradation_whitebg.

        - Improve column type detection: date (/[acmsu]time/), percentage (/%/).

        - Fixes to POD.


0.02    2013-05-01 (SHARYANTO)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Detect bool/num/str column types. Apply some pretty formatting for
          those.


0.01    2013-05-01 (SHARYANTO)

        First "real" release (substantial features implemented). Some border
        styles and color themes separated to
        Text::ANSITable::{BorderStyle,ColorTheme}::Extra. Missing features
        include: autodetection of column types (and setting default
        align/colors/formats) and tests.


0.00    2013-04-12 (SHARYANTO)

        First, very very very minimal release.
