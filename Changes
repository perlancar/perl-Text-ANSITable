0.599_001  2020-06-16  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Released: no; Backward-Compatible: no

        [border style]

        - Now conforms to BorderStyle specification (v2) instead of the old
          Border::Style. The new specification makes each border style a proper
          class on its own instead of just a data structure, so some methods are
          moved there instead of merged into Text::ANSITable. This causes the
          following changes.

        - [incompatible change][removed] Remove attribute 'border_style_args'.
          Arguments now should be given to the border style class directly (see
          next change item).

        - [incompatible change] Attribute 'border_style' now must be a string
          (module name like 'ASCII::SingleLine', or a module name followed by a
          list of comma-separated arguments a la Perl's -M like
          'Test::CustomChar=character,o') or a 2-element array containing module
          name and arguments, e.g. ['ASCII::SingleLine', []] or
          ['Test::CustomChar', {character=>'o'}]. 'border_style' may no longer
          be a hash containing border style structure. You will have to create a
          proper BorderStyle::* module if you want your own custom border style.

        - [incompatible change][removed] Remove methods get_border_style and
          get_border_char. The border style object (stored in 'border_style_obj'
          object hash key) now sports its own get_border_char() method.

        - [incompatible change] Border style names changed. See
          BorderStyles-Standard distribution for a collection of border styles.
          The default border style is now named 'UTF8::BrickOuterOnly' (instead
          of the old name 'Default::bricko'). You can still use the
          'ansitable-list-border-styles' script or see the individual border
          style class to see how a border style looks.

        [color theme]

        - Now conforms to ColorTheme specification (v2) instead of the old
          Color::Theme. The new specification makes each color theme a proper
          class on its own instead of just a data structure, so some methods are
          moved there instead of merged into Text::ANSITable. This causes the
          following changes.

        - [incompatible change][removed] Remove attribute 'color_theme_args'.
          Arguments now should be given to the border style class directly (see
          next change item).

        - [incompatible change] Attribute 'color_theme' now must be a string
          (module name like 'Text::ANSITable::Default::Gradation', or a module
          name followed by a list of comma-separated arguments a la Perl's -M
          like 'Test::Random=cache,0') or a 2-element array containing module
          name and arguments, e.g. ['Text::ANSITable::Default::Gradation', []]
          or ['Test::Random', {cache=>0}]. 'color_theme' may no longer be a hash
          containing color theme structure. You will have to create a proper
          ColorTheme::* module if you want your own custom color theme.

        - [incompatible change] Color theme names changed. See
          ColorThemes-Standard or ColorThemes-Test distribution for a collection
          of generic border styles. The Text-ANSITable distribution itself still
          carries some color themes, now put in
          ColorTheme::Text::ANSITable::Standard::* namespace. The default color
          theme is now named 'Text::ANSITable::Standard::Gradation' (instead of
          the old name 'Default::default_gradation'). You can still use the
          'ansitable-list-color-themes' script or see the individual color theme
          class to see how a color theme looks.

0.22    2013-09-25  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Extract some more code to roles
          SHARYANTO::Role::{BorderStyle,ColorTheme}.

        - Increase spec version for color theme to v=1.1
          (SHARYANTO::Role::ColorTheme 0.58) because multiple color codes should

0.21    2013-09-25  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Extract some code to roles
          SHARYANTO::Role::{BorderStyle,ColorTheme,TermAttrs} to be shared with

          Windows, because currently Term::Size fails to build on my Strawberry
          Perl.


0.16    2013-08-27  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Better default for utf8: turn off if terminal supports Unicode but
          LANG setting is not Unicode.

          http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2013/08/adding-images-to-cpan.html)


0.15    2013-06-26  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Second attempt: 'use experimental "smartmatch"'
          must be given after 'use Moo' (or 'use warnings', to be exact, since
          Moo does that for us).


0.14    2013-06-25  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Add 'use experimental "smartmatch"' for 5.18+.


0.13    2013-05-17  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Tweak adjust width algorithm (now always fit wide table to terminal
          width, when possible).

        - Observe COLUMNS environment variable to override terminal width
          detection.


0.12    2013-05-17  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Adjust wrappable columns' widths so table fits terminal width
           Released-By: currently naive algorithm


0.11    2013-05-17  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Positive width/height setting value (cell_width/column 'width'
          style/cell_height/row 'height' should set maximum and clip content
          that are too wide/long. Previously it acted like a negative value
          (setting minimum and still widens/lengthens if content is too
          wide/long).

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add 'column_wrap'/column 'wrap' style for convenience. Previously you
          have to add a 'wrap' format for this.


0.10    2013-05-16  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Add Text::ANSITable::ColorThemeUtil (moved from
          Text-ANSITable-ColorTheme-Extra, rename sub name)

        - Add get_border_style(), document get_{border_style,color_themes}.


0.09    2013-05-16  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Tweaks and small fixes.

        - Allow column_filter to specify column numbers instead of column names,
          convert them all to column names.

        - ansitable-list-{border-styles,color-themes} scripts: Give more visual
          indicator of selected theme/style (to make it clear under xvt, rxvt).

        - Tweak date column detection (moved routine from
          Data-Format-Pretty-Console).

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Date columns were not aligned middle.


0.08    2013-05-03  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Better detect whether to use utf8 border, whitebg/blackbg color theme
          (using Term::Detect).


0.07    2013-05-03  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - To avoid potential overhead in the future, color_theme() and
          border_style() now requires "SubPackage::name" syntax to avoid listing
          and requiring all style/theme modules.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Observe ANSITABLE_{STYLE,COLUMN_STYLES,ROW_STYLES,CELL_STYLES} to
          customize almost everything via environment.

        - Add more FAQ items.


0.06    2013-05-03  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - This release is a reorganization/tidying up of the API. Lots of
          renaming, sorry.

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Rename attributes 'column_{width,align,pad,lpad,rpad}' -> 'cell_*'.

        - Rename attributes 'row_{valign,vpad,tpad,bpad,height}' -> 'cell_*'.

        - {column,row,cell}_style() now split to
          {get,set}_{column,row,cell}_style() to make them stand out/different
          from table-level {column,row,cell}_* attributes. The set methods now
          can set multiple styles and check for known styles, but they no longer
          return old value.

        - cell() also split to get_cell() and set_cell() (to be more consistent
          with the above).

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add per-row/per-cell styles: align, valign.

        - Add more FAQ items.

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Setting column_align/column_valign didn't work.

        - Setting colors with ANSI escape codes didn't work.

        - Proof-read and update POD.


0.05    2013-05-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Fix bug which breaks Data::Format::Pretty when
          switching from Text::ASCIITable.


0.04    2013-05-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Make the default color theme more readable on terminal emulators with
          white background.


0.03    2013-05-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Add attributes: column_width, row_height.

        - Add color theme: default_gradation_whitebg.

        - Improve column type detection: date (/[acmsu]time/), percentage (/%/).

        - Fixes to POD.


0.02    2013-05-01  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Detect bool/num/str column types. Apply some pretty formatting for
          those.


0.01    2013-05-01  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - First "real" release (substantial features implemented). Some border
          styles and color themes separated to
          Text::ANSITable::{BorderStyle,ColorTheme}::Extra. Missing features
          include: autodetection of column types (and setting default
          align/colors/formats) and tests.


0.00    2013-04-12  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - First, very very very minimal release.
